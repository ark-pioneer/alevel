# Homework

Using classes together: inheritance relationships. The file main.py has a short program that represents
building the elements of a webpage and writing the results to a file. 

Your job is to reorganise (refactor) the code, NOT change implementation, in the main.py file so that you
move the shared behaviour into a parent class. THEN, extend the program with a new class.

## Instructions

### Part 1
1. Identify the shared behaviour in the given classes
2. Extract the shared behaviour to a new class
3. Set up the inheritance relationship for each class that inherits behaviour

### Part 2 
1. Implement the new class AnchorLink
2. Make sure the program runs!
3. You'll know you're successful when the program creates a new file 'nova.html' in your directory.
4. Take a look: open the file up in a web browser!
