Public - any method or property that is available from outside the class (by default, all the methods and properties we have been defining have been public.)

Private - the method or property is NOT accessible from outside the class.

Interface - the set of publicly accessible methods and properties for an object.

*Python doesn't really have a strong distinction between public and private. Python uses a convention to denote what is private. the double underscore preceding a method or property.
